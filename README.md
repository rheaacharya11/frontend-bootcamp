# fe-javascript-tutorial

This is a collection of simple koans to help you learn the basics of the Javascript language. 

### Instructions

For each `exercise-#` folder, open `ExerciseRunner.html` in your browser.  Then complete the tests in each numbered .js file. Do this by replacing `FILL_ME_IN` with the appropriate value in each test. Eventually, all the tests should pass in `ExerciseRunner.html`

### Acknowledgements

Many of the exercises in this tutorial, as well as the Jasmine test setup, was built by David Laing and Greg Malcolm and modified for this tutorial.
